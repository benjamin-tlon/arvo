::    the client and the sub will store the same relation, just pointing to
::    the other build.
::
::    If it's not :verified, then the relation is a guess based on previous
::    builds. These guesses are used to ensure that we hold onto builds we
::    expect to be used in future builds. Each time we run +make on a build,
::    it might produce new :verified sub-builds, which may have been unverified
::    until then. Once a build completes, any unverified sub-builds must be
::    cleaned up, since it turned out they weren't used by the build after all.
::
::    :blocked is used to note that a build can't be completed until that
::    sub-build has been completed. A relation can be :blocked but not :verified
::    if we're trying to promote a build, but we haven't run all its sub-builds
::    yet. In that case, we'll try to promote or run the sub-build in order to
::    determine whether we can promote the client. Until the sub-build has been
::    completed, the client is provisionally blocked on the sub-build.
